in my opinion some behaviors which could be considered as unacceptable
at work for example disrespect and dishonesty if you have a colleague
or boss who never wants to hear anyone else opinion or do more work
than your colleagues without getting paid more colleagues who trust
each other is more likely to deliver bad results and work together poorly
